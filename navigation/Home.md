## Hehehehehehe!
### No one shall stop me!!!!!!!!
    



But... what shall I do with my newfound power?




I have all this power, but not the knowlage to impliment it.




If one has all the power in the world, but didn't know that they had it, are they still powerful?




How does one mesure one's power? A leader's power is judged by how many people they control. However, the power of a weapon is measured by how much destruction and devistation it can cause or facilitate.




Bah! Who cares! I'm gonna put some sillies here now!
