How often are Lists used?\" And my friend, they are used alot. In fact, they are one of the most common data types across all the different coding languages! Long story short, you will need to use them, so learn to like em'!"

    "\n",
    " - \"aList[i]\" can be broken into two parts: aList, and the [i].\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    " - Next is the whatever this thing is -----> [i]. That right there? That's where uou put the stuff you want to list! So, again, with the favorite foods example, you will replace the [i] with ['pizza', 'ice_cream', 'hamburgers'];\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Remember to always use underscores when there is a space, or as an alternative, instead of formatting it like this: \"let favorite_foods\", you can instead use, \"let favoriteFoods\"\n",

    " - Now, putting this all togeather, it should look like this!:\n",
